# BRIEF: MokoStandards Sync Override Configuration for the Standards Repository

# MokoStandards Repository Override Configuration
# This file prevents the bulk_update_repos.py script from recreating
# "live" workflow files in the MokoStandards repository itself.
#
# MokoStandards is a template/standards repository, so it should only
# contain workflow templates and MokoStandards-specific automation,
# not the "live" versions of workflows that get synced TO other repos.
