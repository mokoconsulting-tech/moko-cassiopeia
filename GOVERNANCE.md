## Governance Overview

This document defines the governance framework for the MokoCassiopeia project. The objective is to ensure clear ownership, predictable decision making, and accountable stewardship across development, releases, and community interaction.

## Project Ownership

MokoCassiopeia is owned and maintained by **Moko Consulting**. Final authority for project direction, releases, and policy enforcement resides with the project owner.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for:

* Setting technical direction and release priorities.
* Reviewing and approving pull requests.
* Managing releases and distribution artifacts.
* Enforcing repository policies, including security and conduct requirements.

### Contributors

Contributors may:

* Submit pull requests and issues.
* Propose enhancements and report defects.
* Participate in technical discussions.

Contributors do not have merge authority unless explicitly granted.

## Decision Making

Decisions are made using a maintainers led model:

* Routine changes are approved through pull request review.
* Material changes affecting architecture, branding, licensing, or release processes require maintainer consensus.
* The project owner retains final decision authority if consensus cannot be reached.

## Change Management

Significant changes should:

* Be documented through issues or pull requests with clear rationale.
* Consider backward compatibility and upgrade impact.
* Include documentation updates when behavior or usage changes.

## Release Authority

Only maintainers may:

* Cut releases and publish artifacts.
* Update version numbers and manifests.
* Publish update metadata or advisories.

Release processes follow documented workflows and automation standards.

## Security Governance

Security issues are governed by the SECURITY.md policy. Maintainers are responsible for confidential handling, coordinated disclosure, and publication of advisories when appropriate.

## Conduct Enforcement

Behavior within the project is governed by CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. Maintainers are responsible for enforcement actions and escalation handling.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are handled through:

* Direct discussion between involved parties when appropriate.
* Maintainer mediation when necessary.
* Final determination by the project owner if required.

## External Dependencies

The project depends on Joomla core and other third party components. Governance of upstream projects remains outside the scope of this repository, but upstream changes may influence project decisions.

## Jurisdiction

This project is managed from Tennessee, USA. This statement is informational and does not constitute legal advice.
